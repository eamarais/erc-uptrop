TROPOMI cloud-slicing and validation code

Files copied from eam-group repo (https://github.com/eamarais/eam-group/tree/master/eloise/uptrop)

Citation where details of the method, and interpretation and visualization of the data is Marais et al., 2020.

Decription of project. ERC Starting Grant to address uncertainties in reactive nitrogen in the upper troposphere. 
Includes python code and routines to apply cloud-slicing to partial columns of NO2 to obtain mising ratios of NO2 in the upper tropposhepre. The routine
that does this is cloud_slice_ut_no2.py. 

Add higher-order description of what's in the folders (documentation of what each routine does and how to run and use each routine, )
