Welcome to UpTrop's documentation!
==================================
Software used to derive vertical profiles of mixing ratios of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the ESA TROPOMI space-based instrument using the cloud-slicing techniques. Details of the retrieval process are in the peer-reviewed open access Atmospheric Measurement Techniques paper by `Marais et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2389-2021>`__. 

The software is written in Python for the `ERC Starting Grant project UpTrop <https://maraisresearchgroup.co.uk/uptrop.html>`__ led by `Dr Eloise Marais <https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/eloise-marais>`__. Initial code development and documentation is by Eloise Marais, with first version code and documentation improvements by software engineer Dr John Roberts, and now taken over by UCL research fellow `Dr Gongda Lu <https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/research-staff/gongda-lu/dr-gongda-lu>`__.
