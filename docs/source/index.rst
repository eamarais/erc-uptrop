Welcome to UpTrop's documentation!
==================================
Here you will find all the relevant details of the functionality of the code used to generate results described and discussed Marais et al. (2020). The Python code was developed for the `ERC Starting Grant project UpTrop <https://maraisresearchgroup.co.uk/uptrop.html>`__ led by Eloise Marais. Substantive code edits and improvements and documentation preparation are by software engineer John Roberts and by research fellow Gongda Lu.
