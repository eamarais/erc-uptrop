Welcome to Documentation for Uptrop Software!
=============================================

**Uptrop** is a Python-based software designed to convert satellite observations
of total atmospheric column densities of air pollutants to vertical profiles in
the global troposphere using the cloud-slicing technique.

Currently, Uptrop retrieves nitrogen dioxide (NO\ :sub:`2`) and ozone (O\ :sub:`3`)
mixing ratios in custom vertical layers throughout the troposphere, using total
column densities of NO\ :sub:`2` and O\ :sub:`3` from the ESA Sentinel-5P TROPOMI
instrument.

This brief documentation provides details of relevant references, data products,
sample output, guidance on installing and using the software, and how to ask for
help or report bugs, issues and suggested code updates.
