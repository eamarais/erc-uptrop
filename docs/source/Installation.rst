Installation
==================

To download the latest stable version of the cloud-slicing uptrop-py code, type:

$ git clone https://github.com/eamarais/erc-uptrop.git

This command clones the source code to a folder called erc-uptrop

To download GEOS-Chem Classic source code into a folder named something other than :file:`erc-uptrop`, supply the name of the folder at the end of the :command:`git clone` command. For example:

git clone https://github.com/eamarais/erc-uptrop.git my-code-dir

This will download the source code into :file:`my-code-dir` instead of :file:`erc-uptrop`.
